## Overview
`AddHexCommentsScript` is a Ghidra Python script designed to add hexadecimal comments to specific addresses in a Ghidra project. The script processes a specified address range and alternately adds hexadecimal comments, incrementing the value with each new comment.

## Features
- Adds a formatted hexadecimal comment (`0xXXXXXXXX`) to every other address within a specified range.
- Starts with a predefined hexadecimal value and increments it at each step.
- Stops execution if a specified hex value limit is reached.

## Prerequisites
- Ghidra must be installed and set up.
- A program must be loaded in Ghidra for the script to run successfully.

## Installation
1. Copy the script into a Python file within your Ghidra scripts directory.
2. Load the script from the Ghidra Script Manager.

## Usage
1. Open a program in Ghidra.
2. Run the script via the Ghidra Script Manager.
3. The script will print the current program and indicate when it starts processing the specified address range.

## How It Works
- The script starts by checking if `currentProgram` is loaded. If not, it prompts the user to open a program.
- The script initializes a starting hexadecimal value (`0xC58`) and defines the start and end addresses (`0x000ef574` to `0x000ef6c0`).
- It processes addresses in sequence and alternates adding comments.
- The comment format is `0xXXXXXXXX` with the current hexadecimal value.
- The script increments the hex value after each comment and toggles a flag to skip every other address.
- The script stops if the hex value exceeds `0xCFF`.

## Output
- Console log messages indicating the progress, including:
  - The starting and ending address of the range.
  - Each comment added and the corresponding address.
  - A notification when the hex value limit is reached, ending the script.

## Script Structure
```python
from ghidra_program.model.address import AddressSet
from ghidra.app.script import GhidraScript

class AddHexCommentsScript(GhidraScript):
    def run(self):
        # Check if a program is loaded and start adding comments
```

## Notes
- **Error Handling**: The script checks if a program is loaded. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
- **Hex Value Limit**: The script stops if the hex value reaches `0xCFF` to avoid exceeding reasonable comment additions.

## Customization
- **Initial Hex Value**: Modify `hex_values = 0xC58` to start with a different value.
- **Address Range**: Change `start_address` and `end_address` as needed for different address ranges.
- **Skipping Logic**: The script alternates comments; adjust `add_comment` logic if continuous comments are needed.

## Example Run
```
Add hex comments
<currentProgram info>
Script started. Processing from address 000ef574 to 000ef6c0
Adding comment 0x00000c58 to address 000ef574
Adding comment 0x00000c59 to address 000ef576
...
Hex value limit reached, stopping script
```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the script runs within Ghidra's scripting environment.
- Check for valid start and end addresses to avoid errors in address processing.
- Ensure `currentProgram` is open before running the script to prevent early termination.

Feel free to adjust the initial hex value, address range, and processing logic to suit your specific needs.
